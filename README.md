# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a project designed for managing user sessions and storing data in a React Native application. It leverages the power of asynchronous storage through the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` library, providing a simple yet effective way to handle user-related data.

## Installation
To install the project and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd user-workspace
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
Here’s how to use the User Workspace in your React Native application:

1. Import the Async Storage module:
    ```javascript
    import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
    ```

2. Use the provided methods to save, retrieve, and delete user data from storage:
    ```javascript
    // To save data
    const storeData = async (key, value) => {
        try {
            const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(value);
            await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, jsonValue);
        } catch (e) {
            // saving error
        }
    };

    // To retrieve data
    const getData = async (key) => {
        try {
            const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
            return jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;
        } catch (e) {
            // error reading value
        }
    };

    // To remove data
    const removeData = async (key) => {
        try {
            await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);
        } catch (e) {
            // error removing value
        }
    };
    ```
